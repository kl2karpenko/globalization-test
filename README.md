### Project: **Task Management Web Application**

#### Project Description:
Create a simple web application for managing tasks that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks. The application should have a modern look and feel using Material-UI components and should support localization (at least two languages) and be accessible.

#### Main Requirements:
1. **Frontend:**
   - Use React to build the UI.
   - Style with Material-UI, ensuring the design is responsive for different screen sizes.
   - Support at least two languages using the react-intl library.
   - Implement accessibility: keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, and labels.

2. **Backend:**
   - Create a simple REST API with Node.js and Express (or C#) to handle requests for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks.
   - Store task data in the server memory (database usage is not required).

3. **Additional Tasks:**
   - Implement authentication/authorization functionality to differentiate access to tasks.
   - Use WebSocket for real-time notification about task updates.

#### Discussion Questions for the Interview After Completing the Project:

1. What challenges did you encounter while implementing the project?
2. How did you approach implementing localization and ensuring accessibility?
3. What solutions from Material-UI did you use and why?
4. Describe how you organized work with the API on the backend.
5. Which aspects of accessibility do you consider most important, and how were they implemented in the project?
